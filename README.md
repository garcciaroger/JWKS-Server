Developed a RESTful JWKS server using Python and Flask, that provides public keys with unique identifiers (kid) for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), implements key expiry for enhanced security, includes an authentication endpoint, and handles the issuance of JWTs with expired keys based on a query parameter.
